burnpkg - A simple tool to remove packages from the system

OPTIONS:

-b, -burn
   PackageName

-h, --help
   Displays this help and exits

HOW TO USE?

   Assuming you want to remove a package from the system, for
   example google_chrome, you must run as root:

   # burnpkg google_chrome

   And burnpkg will do the work for you! All files and directories
   belonging to that package will be removed from the system. But remember,
   burnpkg won't remove the package dependencies, so you have to burn one package at a time.
   This is your task.
  
   NOTE!
   If the command returns nothing, it means that the package does not exist in the system.

LISTS

   The list of packages you created with createpkg is in /var/log/list/,
   burnpkg checks the list in this directory!
